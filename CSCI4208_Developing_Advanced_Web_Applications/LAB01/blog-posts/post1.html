                        Companies have been looking for new ways of dealing with the influx of online users now that more and 
                        more people are finding themselves online to conveniently complete a myriad of task. Anything from binge 
                        watching a good TV show to shopping for groceries online, there has been a steady increase of users being 
                        drawn to the convince of online services and, thusly, a need to efficiently manage users has given rise to 
                        the idea of microservices and containers. This new technique of web applications has kept the need for a 
                        significant increase in computing power at bay.

                        Gone are the days of virtual machines as a way of dealing with multiple users who are using a webserver at the <br> 
                        same time. Virtual machines are a way of allowing many users to use a server as once. It works by spinning up a <br> 
                        virtual machine any time a user is trying to access a web application, such as Netflix. This way of handling multiple <br> 
                        users required more resources since each userâ€™s virtual machine would use the entire code base, which can be millions <br> 
                        of lines of code, even if a user only wanted to do something simple such as make a payment. This approach became more <br>
                        useless as more users since that would mean more virtual machines running on a server at any given time making it <br>
                        more difficult for the server to keep up. This is where microservices comes into play.

                            Microservices takes a much more resource conservative approach to the problem of more users and the resource cap <br>
                            of a server.  Microservices are a type of container deployment that allows supports the concept of microservices. <br>
                            Each container can be made to do a specific task which means a lot less code to be run on the server, typically a <br>
                            fraction of the entire code base. This means that if a user only wants to do a simple task, such as pay a bill, <br>
                            rate a movie, or turn the volume up on a video, a container specific to the task will be generated to execute the <br>
                            code. Typically, at any given instance in time, a user would only need one container.<br>

                                Although this solution is great, the new task of tracking what tasks a container perform and any containers it may<br>
                                depend on becomes a problem. Google developed a container management system called Kubernetes which was tailored to<br>
                                solve to help make managing containers a lot simpler. It also allows certain services to be added, removed, or <br>
                                edited without affecting the entire program or system. Another added benefit is that errors are easier to track <br>
                                since containers typically only do a specific job.
